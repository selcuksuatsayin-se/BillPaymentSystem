## 🏗 Architectural and Design Decisions

The project is built on a **Monolithic** structure and operates an **API Gateway** logic using **Modular** principles and **Middleware** architecture.

### Core Components
***API Gateway (Middleware):** Instead of a separate server, *Rate Limiting* and *Logging* operations are managed centrally with special middleware running at the project's entry level.
***Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Token) is used. [cite_start]Admin and User roles are separated.
***Database:** Azure SQL Database (using a Code-First approach).
***Logging:** All Request/Response traffic (Headers, Body sizes, Latency, etc.) is stored in the `ApiLogs` table in the database.

### Kullanılan Teknolojiler
* .NET 8 Web API
* Entity Framework Core (SQL Server)
* JWT Bearer Authentication
* Swagger / OpenAPI (Swashbuckle Annotations)
* CsvHelper (For batch processing)

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

**1. Admin Login & Upload Invoices:**
* Obtain tokens via `/api/v1/Auth/login` using `**********`.
* Enter the token in the Authorize button.
* Upload invoices using the `Admin` endpoints.

**2. Rate Limiting Test:**
* Log in as any subscriber.
* Send four consecutive requests to the `/api/v1/Subscriber/bills` endpoint.
* The 4th request will result in a **429 Too Many Requests** error.

**3. Payment (No Auth):**
* You can make payments without using tokens via the `/api/v1/Payment/pay` endpoint.
